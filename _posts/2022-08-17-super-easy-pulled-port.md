Personally, I love a good pulled pork sandwich, and I'm willing to pay for it, especially at Bubba's BBQ, just over the Missouri border.

For the longest time, I thought that this delicacy was a high art beyond my culinary capability. And yes, it probably is on the high end, but it turns out that you can get pretty close to high end with just a slow cooker and dang near anything in your fridge and pantry.

There are four key ingredients to a tasty pulled pork sandwich.

1. Pork Shoulder; you might find this as Pork Butt in your grocery store; same thing.
2. Some kind of acidic ingredient, like vinegar or citrus juices, or even a can of soda. (We tried Dr. Pepper once.)
3. Some kind of sweet and savory (and spicy?) something. You can use off-the-shelf BBQ sauce, honey mustard, ketchup and brown sugar, mango puree; you do you. Use up all those KC Masterpiece and Chick Fil'a dippin' sauces you got piled up in the side drawer. It'll be good, trust me.
4. Bread and toppings. I have a weakness for Kaiser rolls, but you can go full on Ciabatta with Herbs&trade; or day old bargain buns; don't matter. Seek out some toppings to make the creation uniquely yours: cheese, more BBQ sauce, fried onions, spicy pickles; whatever.

## Recipe Card

* 3 lb    - Pork Shoulder (aka Pork Butt)
* 1/2 cup - Apple Cider Vinegar
* 16 oz   - Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce
* 4       - Kaiser Rolls
* 4       - Famous Dave's Spicy Pickles

Prepare the meat: there will be a good deal of fat on any pork shoulder you buy. Cut off most of the large sections of fat. You don't have to remove it all; you want some to add flavor; leave more if you want a fattier end product.

> Optional : Pork Rub
> 
>* Brown Sugar
>* Paprika
>* Mustard
> 
> Rub the pork shoulder with mustard, then mix the brown sugar and paprika together and sprinkle it all over the meat, rubbing it in. as you go until it's all coated. Cover in saran wrap and let it sit overnight in the fridge.

Mix the vinegar and bbq sauce in a bowl until it's a sauce. Pour about half of it into your crock pot or slow cooker just cover the bottom; then add your pork shoulder; then pour in the rest of the sauce.

Cook covered on low for 6-8 hours. Resist the temptation to open the lid throughout the day; keep those aromas inside.

Now, you have two choices. You can shred the pork in all those juices, or you can pull it out and shred it on a plate. It all depends on how messy you want it to be. I like it messy.

Serve on rolls with pickles.
