Welcome to Baker's Acre! We try out best to make sure that the discussions on our content are free from trolls, spam, and abuse ... but we're not God and we may need your help keeping it clean. The comment section can be a great way to connect with us and other readers. In order to keep it safe and fun, please make sure to obey these guidelines:

1. Be polite; don't be rude to anyone; be respectful to others. Remember that there are real people on the other end of the line.
1. Don't troll. We welcome criticism towards our staff and writers, but comments that add no value or are insulting in nature will be deleted.
1. Don't spam. We aren't interested.

If you find any comments which violate our guidelines or the spirit therein, please make sure to flag them for our moderators to address. Thanks!
